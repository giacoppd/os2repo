This isn't before edits because I just put them in the file, but the jist is
first, we need to scan all pages for one with enough blocks. We in theory
find the one with the least blocks wasted, then call slob alloc page on it.
That one finds the set of blocks that is the best fit and shoves it in there.
For this case, if it finds a perfect fit, it stops and shoves it there,
otherwise it checks all lists of blocks and shoves it in the best fit.
I have no idea how to do the defragger at this time.
